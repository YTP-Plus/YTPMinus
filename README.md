## YTP- is a parody of [YTP+](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlus)
### It includes:

  - Watermarking so nobody steals your creation
  - Downscaling so you can send it through services like Discord easily
  - Automatic outro placement so you don't forget to add it
  

## What is YTP+ and YTP-?
YTP+ is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate YouTube Poop videos.
YTP- is the name given to this tool, which I no longer support.

## How do I use YTP-?
To get this tool working, you'll need to install a few things (Node.js, FFmpeg, and frei0r-plugins) and do some manual tinkering. Here's how to do so:
- **Step 1:** Download the latest release from <https://github.com/YTP-Plus/YTPMinus/releases>
- **Step 2:** Download the latest FFmpeg binaries (FFmpeg-x86_64) from <https://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer/> and only there
- **Step 3:** Download the latest frei0r-plugins-x86_64 from <https://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer/> as well
- **Step 4:** Download the LTS release of node.js from <https://nodejs.org/>
- **Step 5:** Extract FFmpeg to a secure location and add it to your system PATH (<https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/>)
  - **Step 5a:** If you have installed FFmpeg somewhere before, make sure that the folder is at the top of your system PATH
- **Step 6:** Install frei0r by adding a folder named ``frei0r-1`` to your FFmpeg directory and extracting the contents of the frei0r-- - plugins-x86_64 file there
- **Step 7:** Extract YTP- to a secure location
- **Step 8:** Install Node.JS in its default location, making sure that it is added to your system PATH
- **Step 9:** Shift+Right click in the YTP- folder and open a command/PowerShell window there (if you can't do this, open a cmd window and navigate there instead)
- **Step 10:** Type ``npm install`` in the YTP- folder and it should install YTP-, ignore any errors
You should now be able to drag a video file (preferably an MP4 that is in the same directory as the program) onto the ``launch.bat`` file and generate YouTube Poops!
If you come across any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [YTP+ Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/bzhzRmg).

You should now have YTP- ready to use, have fun!
